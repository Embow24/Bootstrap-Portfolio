# Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Description
This portfolio was a recreation of my existing portfolio with the use of Bootstrap. Bootstrap was implemented throughout the html file due to the usage of a nav bar, jumbotron, grid, cards, lists, rows and footers. The motivation behind using these insertions from Bootstrap was to reduce the number of media queries stated and the amount of styling that needed to be documented in the css file.

# Usage
To acces this portfolio there is a navigation bar at the top of the page with links to the various sections within the portfolio. After the navigation bar, a jumbotron has been inserted with some information about me and a profile picture. Below that is a grid that contains Bootstrap cards to display pieces of work created by myself. Each card links to the deployed webpage when the button is clicked. Then a list has been used to show the skills I currently obtain. After that, two cards have been placed in a row, one describes what I have achieved and the second describes my future goals. Finally, a footer was added with hyper-linked buttons to show contact information for GitHub, Gmail and LinkedIn.

Below is a screenshot of the Bootstrap portfolio.
